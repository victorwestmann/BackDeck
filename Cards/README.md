Why this project?
-----------------
Because the back of tarot cards ten to be awesome.

My grandmother played tarot to me when I was a kid and since then I'm amazed by this oracle. And I love SVG graphics. So why not merge those two interests? ;-)

How can I generate a .PNG file from these .SVG?
-----------------------------------------------

- Download Inkscape (http://inkscape.org/download/?lang=en).
- Open Inkscape.
- Select your image. (1 left mouse click)
- Go to option **File** > **Export Bitmap...** > (choose your settings and set your path to the PNG image to be generated and) Click **Export**.
- Done. Enjoy!
